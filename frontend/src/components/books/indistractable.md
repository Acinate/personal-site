* External distractions: phone ringing, email, people, computer.
* Traction: Aligned with our internal intentions.
* Distraction: Misaligned with our internal intentions.
* Traction helps us achieve our goals and distraction leads us away from them.
* The cell phone gets blamed, but before the cell phone was the television and before that was the telephone, before that were comic books and radio, even the written word (books).
* Distractions will always be part of life, however today's distractions are different in that they call out for our attention.
* Attention and focus are the raw materials of human creativity.
* Close friendships are the bedrock of physcological and physical health.
* Lonliness is more dangerous than obesity.
* Distractions will always exist, managing them, is our responsibility.

## Chaper 3: Master Internal Triggers
* Nature has put man under the control of two sovereign masters: pain and pleasure.
* When we think we are seeking pleasure, we are actually trying to free ourselves from the pain of wanting.
* Motivation has much less to do with pleasure that we think.
* Pleasure is the absence of pain in the body and trouble in the soul.
* Television, social media, smoking, video games are things we tend to blame, but these are all proximate causes of our distractions.
* Distraction isn't about the distraction itself, it is how we respond to it.
* Distraction is always an unhealthy escape from reality.
* How we deal with uncomfortable internal triggers determines whether we pursue healthy forms of traction or unhealthy forms of distraction.
* If we do not deal with the root issue that is causing the internal prompt to distract ourselves, then we will always look for a distraction.
* We need to understand what is causing us to be uncomfortable.
* Understand the root cause of distraction. The distraction isn't the problem, it's the root cause. Separate proximate causes from the root cause.
* All motivation is a desire to escape discomfort.
## Chapter 4: Time Management is Pain Management
* The only way to handle distraction is to handle discomfort.
* If distraction costs us time, then time management is paint management.
* Humans are naturally wired to never been fully satisfied or happy with life.
* If we ever got to the point of being completely satisfied, the human species would go extinct.
* The lengths people go to avoid boredom is shocking.
* People prefer doing to thinking. (Boredom test with shock button)
* People are negative by nature. Negativity has greater power than neutrality or positivity.
* People tend to remember bad memories more than good memories.
* Humans have a tendency to return to a baseline satisfaction level no matter what happens to us.
* Disatisfaction is a power that we can use to channel motivation to accomplish goals.
* Feeling bad isn't necesarrily bad, it is intended for the survival of the fittest. We can recognize pain and rise above it.
* If we want to master distraction we must learn to deal with discomfort.
