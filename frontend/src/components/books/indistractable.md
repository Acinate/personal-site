# Indistractable

## Chapter 1: 
* Over use of devices has negative consequences.
* First step is to understand that distraction comes from within.
* You can't call something a distraction, if you don't know what it's distracting you from.
## Chapter 2: Being Indistractable
* Internal distractions: hunger, sadness, loneliness.
* External distractions: phone ringing, email, people, computer.
* Traction: Aligned with our internal intentions.
* Distraction: Misaligned with our internal intentions.
* Traction helps us achieve our goals and distraction leads us away from them.
* The cell phone gets blamed, but before the cell phone was the television and before that was the telephone, before that were comic books and radio, even the written word (books).
* Distractions will always be part of life, however today's distractions are different in that they call out for our attention.
* Attention and focus are the raw materials of human creativity.
* Close friendships are the bedrock of physiological and physical health.
* Loneliness is more dangerous than obesity.
* Distractions will always exist, managing them, is our responsibility.
* Indistractable people are as honest with themselves as they are with other people.
* Distraction stops you from achieving your goals. Any action that moves you away from what you really want.
* Traction moves you closer to your goal. It is any action that moves you toward what you really want.
* Triggers prompt both traction and distraction. External triggers are prompts form the environment. Internal triggers are prompts from within you.
## Chapter 3: Master Internal Triggers
* Nature has put man under the control of two sovereign masters: pain and pleasure.
* When we think we are seeking pleasure, we are actually trying to free ourselves from the pain of wanting.
* Motivation has much less to do with pleasure that we think.
* Pleasure is the absence of pain in the body and trouble in the soul.
* Television, social media, smoking, video games are things we tend to blame, but these are all proximate causes of our distractions.
* Distraction isn't about the distraction itself, it is how we respond to it.
* Distraction is always an unhealthy escape from reality.
* How we deal with uncomfortable internal triggers determines whether we pursue healthy forms of traction or unhealthy forms of distraction.
* If we do not deal with the root issue that is causing the internal prompt to distract ourselves, then we will always look for a distraction.
* We need to understand what is causing us to be uncomfortable.
* Understand the root cause of distraction. The distraction isn't the problem, it's the root cause. Separate proximate causes from the root cause.
* All motivation is a desire to escape discomfort.
## Chapter 4: Time Management is Pain Management
* The only way to handle distraction is to handle discomfort.
* If distraction costs us time, then time management is paint management.
* Humans are naturally wired to never been fully satisfied or happy with life.
* If we ever got to the point of being completely satisfied, the human species would go extinct.
* The lengths people go to avoid boredom is shocking.
* People prefer doing to thinking. (Boredom test with shock button)
* People are negative by nature. Negativity has greater power than neutrality or positivity.
* People tend to remember bad memories more than good memories.
* Humans have a tendency to return to a baseline satisfaction level no matter what happens to us.
* Dissatisfaction is a power that we can use to channel motivation to accomplish goals.
* Feeling bad isn't necessarily bad, it is intended for the survival of the fittest. We can recognize pain and rise above it.
* If we want to master distraction we must learn to deal with discomfort.
## Chapter 5: Deal with Distraction From Within
## Chapter 6: Re-imagine the Internal Trigger
* We shouldn't keep telling ourselves to resist an urge, we should find better ways to cope.
* Rather than fight the urge, we need new methods to handle intrusive thoughts.
* Step 1: Look for the discomfort that precedes the distraction. Focus on the internal trigger.
* Step 2: Write down the trigger. (Write down the time of day, what you were doing and how you felt when you noticed the trigger)
* Step 3: Explore your sensations. (Do your fingers twitch, butterflies in stomach?)
* Step 4: Beware of litimal moments. (Loading time, waiting time, distracting yourself when waiting for something)
* Bonus: When you get the urge to do something, say to yourself "Not now, but in 10 minutes I'll do that thing"
* When you pay attention to negative thoughts, they tend to dissipate, when you pay attention to positive thoughts, they expand.
* By re-imagining an internal trigger we can disarm it.
## Chapter 7: Re-imagine the task
* Fun doesn't have to 'feel' good. Play doesn't have to be pleasurable.
* Re-imagining difficult work as fun could prove incredibly empowering.
* Fun and Play can be used as tools to make us stay focused.
* Fun is the ability to focus on the task at hand.
* Instead of running away from pain or using rewards like prizes or treats to keep us motivated, the idea is to pay such close attention that you see problems where you didn't before.
* Pay an extreme amount of close attention to menial tasks. (Ex: mowing the lawn, find the most efficient way to mow the lawn, the fastest way, etc.)
* It's breaking through the boredom and monotony to discover its hidden beauty.
* Find novelty is only possible when we give ourselves the time to focus intently on a task and look hard at variability.
* We can master triggers by re-imagining an otherwise dreary task.
* Fun and play can be used as tools to keep us focused.
* Play doesn't have to be pleasurable, it just has to hold our attention.
* Deliberateness and novelty can be added to any task to make it fun.
## Chapter 8: Re-imagine your temperament
* Temperament: A person's or animal's nature, especially as it effects their behavior.
* There is a misconception that self control is limited, that we only have a certain amount of willpower each day. This is known as 'ego depletion'.
* People who did not believe that willpower was a limited resource did not show signs of ego-depletion.
* Willpower is not a resource but it is an emotion, like anger or happiness willpower flows in and out of our consciousness.
* Mindset is more powerful than any physical dependence.
* Speak kindly to yourself after experiencing setbacks and failures. (ex: "This is what it's like to get better at something")
* Re-imagining the internal trigger, the task, and our temperament are powerful and established ways to deal with distractions that start within us.
* We can cope with uncomfortable internal triggers by reflecting on, rather than reacting to our discomfort.
* We can re-imagine the task we are trying to accomplish by looking for the fun in it and focusing on it more intensely.
* We can change the way we see ourselves to get rid of self limiting beliefs.
* "You are only powerless if you **think** you are."
* Re-imagining our temperament can help us manage our internal triggers.
* We don't run out of willpower, believing we do makes us less likely to accomplish our goals by providing a rational to quit when we could otherwise persist.
* What we say to ourselves matters. Labeling yourself as having poor self control is self defeating. Practice self compassion. Talk to yourself the way you to talk to a friend.
# PART 2: Make time for traction
## Chapter 9: Turn your values into time
* We perform better under constraints.
* It doesn't matter what you do with your time, rather, success is measured by whether you did what you planned to do.
* It's fine to surf social media, watch videos, as long as that is what you planned to do.
* Alternatively, checking work email, a presumable productive task, turns into a distraction when you do it during time you planned to spend with your family.
* Keeping a time box schedule is the only way to determine whether you are being distracted.
* The three primary domains in life are: Yourself, Relationships and Work.
* Reflect on your calendar every week by asking 2 questions:
* 1. When in my schedule did I do what I planned to do and when did I get distracted. What kind of distraction was it? (Check distraction log)
* 2. Are there changes I can make to my calendar that will give me the time I need to better live out my values.
* Revise your schedule regularly, but you must commit to it, once its set.
